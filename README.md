# StockSage - Smart Stock Consultant Agent
*Where Wisdom Meets Investing*

StockSage is an AI-powered stock market consultant that provides beginner-friendly investment advice. Built with Next.js, it combines rule-based analysis with AI-generated insights to help users make informed investment decisions.

## Features

- **Portfolio Analysis**: Input your stocks and get comprehensive analysis
- **AI-Powered Advice**: Get personalized investment recommendations with Gemini AI
- **Risk Assessment**: Understand your portfolio's risk level and diversification
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitor your analysis usage with Flexprice integration
- **Real-time Data**: Live stock data via Pathway integration (with mock fallback)

## Environment Setup

To enable full functionality, add these environment variables to your Vercel project:

### Required API Keys

1. **Gemini API Key** (for AI-powered advice generation):
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Flexprice API Key** (for usage tracking and billing):
   ```
   FLEXPRICE_API_KEY=your_flexprice_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Pathway API Key** (for real-time stock data):
   ```
   PATHWAY_API_KEY=your_pathway_api_key_here
   ```

### How to Add Environment Variables

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
3. Add the variables above with your actual API keys
4. Redeploy your application

### Getting API Keys

#### Google Gemini Setup
1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
2. Create an API key for Gemini
3. Copy your API key

#### Flexprice Setup
1. Visit [Flexprice.io](https://flexprice.io)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Create a new project
4. Copy your API key from the dashboard
5. Configure usage events for:
   - `portfolio_analysis`
   - `advice_generation`
   - `stock_search`

#### Pathway Setup
1. Visit [Pathway.com](https://pathway.com)
2. Sign up for their financial data API
3. Subscribe to stock data endpoints
4. Copy your API key from the dashboard

### Fallback Behavior

StockSage is designed to work even without API keys:

- **Without Gemini**: Rule-based advice will be used instead of AI-generated advice
- **Without Flexprice**: Usage tracking will log to console instead of billing service
- **Without Pathway**: Mock stock data will be used for demonstrations

This allows you to test and develop the application before setting up paid integrations.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application.
